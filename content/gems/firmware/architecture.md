The architecture of the body's real-time code: the firmware on the
microcontrollers, and the real-time controller's modules, which are firmware or
software according to decision D-3 ([spec 07.1](/vault/gems/07-firmware-and-software/#71-the-division)).
Their deadlines are the same either way. The specification states what this
code must guarantee; this document states how the work is divided so that it can, and — the part that is genuinely new here —
**how the 10 ms reflex budget is spent**.

Nothing below fixes a part. Where a figure depends on hardware not yet chosen it
is marked `⟦IMPL⟧` and stays marked.

## 1. Modules and the deadline each owns

| Module | Owns | Deadline | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sensor drivers** | Acquisition and timestamping at source, on the embedded nodes — IMU, encoders, joint torque, tactile readout. Camera, LiDAR, audio and SDR capture run on the application processor and are software ([07.1](/vault/gems/07-firmware-and-software/#71-the-division)) | per-channel rate | [07.2](/vault/gems/07-firmware-and-software/#72-real-time-requirements) |
| **Time base** | One clock all channels share, established at transport | skew below the reflex budget | 07.2 |
| **Actuator drivers** | Current and position loops | `⟦IMPL⟧`, kHz-class | 07.2 |
| **State estimator** | Joint state, IMU fusion, contact state | 1 kHz | 07.2 |
| **Balance controller** | Posture and ZMP | **≥ 500 Hz** | 07.2 |
| **Reflex path** | Reflex decision and command | **≤ 10 ms** end to end | 07.2 |
| **Power state machine** | The four levels, and wake latency per level | transition-bounded | [03.4](/vault/gems/03-energy/#34-four-state-levels) |
| **Safe-state supervisor** | Reaching a supported posture on fault | must beat the fall | [07.3](/vault/gems/07-firmware-and-software/#73-what-the-real-time-code-must-guarantee) |
| **Attestation agent** | Measured boot, per-node signatures, challenge responses | boot and on demand | [06.3](/vault/gems/06-audit-surface/#63-three-tiers-of-attestation) |
| **Log writer** | Full-tier records, hash-chained at loop rate | loop rate | [06.4](/vault/gems/06-audit-surface/#64-audit-log) |
| **Low-power beacon** | Signed summary at quiescent power | duty-cycled | [06.5](/vault/gems/06-audit-surface/#65-low-power-beacon) |

**One rule across all of them.** A module that misses its deadline must say so.
A late result delivered silently is worse than a reported miss, because the
layer above cannot tell the difference between fresh and stale, and the log will
record a decision made on data that was not what it appeared to be.

## 2. The reflex budget

10 ms is the whole path — stimulus at a sensor to motion at an actuator, not
the compute portion of it. A proposed division:

| Stage | Budget | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Acquisition and timestamp | 1.0 ms | Includes transduction at the node |
| Agency tagging | 0.5 ms | Self-caused or external, before anything interprets |
| State assembly | 2.0 ms | Assembling the state the reflex decision reads |
| Reflex decision | 1.0 ms | Lookup against the loaded reflex set; not skipped (RSIL INV-8: appraisal under a scar-dominated field, [spec 08.2](/vault/gems/08-platform-contract/#82-traced-appraisal-not-mute-reflex)) |
| Command and actuation onset | 4.0 ms | Mechanical response begins |
| Log write | 0.05 ms | Compact context record |
| **Margin** | **1.45 ms** | Unallocated, deliberately |
| **Total** | **10.0 ms** | |

> **The log write is 0.5% of the budget.** This is the number that answers the
> objection that a context record per reflex (RSIL: traced appraisal) costs too
> much to run at reflex speed. It does
> not. What it costs is the discipline of having a place to write to, which is a
> design constraint rather than a time cost — see
> [06.7](/vault/gems/06-audit-surface/#67-hard-constraints).
>
> **The reflex decision stage is not optional and not zero.** It still runs,
> however little it has left to decide; that is what makes the output event
> re-appraisable from outside, which is what RSIL INV-8 asks. A
> firmware design that discovers it is over budget and reclaims this millisecond
> has stopped conforming ([protocol C-9](/vault/gems/protocol/conformance/)).

The split is `⟦IMPL⟧` and will move once real parts exist. The same figures are
held, with every task's layer and deadline class, in
[`../realtime_config/tasks.csv`](https://github.com/PloneMraz/GEMs/blob/HEAD/realtime_config/tasks.csv), and
`python realtime_config/check_timing.py` fails if the two disagree. The margin is not
spare capacity to be spent later — it absorbs the jitter that measurement will
find.

## 3. The balance loop

500 Hz is a 2 ms period. Within it:

| Stage | Budget |
|---|---|
| State estimate | 0.6 ms |
| Control solve | 0.8 ms |
| Command dispatch | 0.3 ms |
| Log write | 0.05 ms |
| Margin | 0.25 ms |

Balance and reflex share sensors and actuators but not deadlines. Where they
contend, **balance wins**: a body that reflexes correctly while falling has
failed at the thing that keeps the reflex worth having.

## 4. The interface to the edge software

The real-time code — firmware, and the real-time controller whichever layer D-3
puts it in — hands up; the edge AI module's software hands down. The boundary is
narrow on purpose.

| Direction | Carries | Rate |
|---|---|---|
| **Up** | Timestamped sensor records, each already carrying its agency tag | per-channel |
| **Up** | Joint telemetry for the full-tier log | loop rate |
| **Up** | Deadline-miss and fault notifications | on event |
| **Down** | Motion intent, not motion commands | on event |
| **Down** | Power state requests | on event |
| **Down** | Gating: which channels run at full rate | on event |
| **Down** | The loop's self-report for the beacon (`loop_state`, RSIL C5), carried unaltered | on event |

**Agency tagging is real-time code.** It is a hard real-time stage of the reflex path,
and it needs the commanded value and the measured value in the same place at the
same time
([07.3](/vault/gems/07-firmware-and-software/#73-what-the-real-time-code-must-guarantee), guarantee 7):
once a stream has crossed upward without its tag, the information that would
have carried it has already been averaged away.

**The edge software sends intent, not commands.** The final command belongs to a
hard real-time task, so it belongs to the real-time code. Edge software that
could write actuator values directly could also miss a deadline while holding
them, and nothing on the edge module bounds its latency.

## 5. Link loss

The local core is the real-time code plus the minimum edge software needed to
keep logging. On
link loss it maintains balance, preserves state and log, continues recording at
both tiers, and attempts re-establishment.

**It does not decide.** The boundary is stated at
[07.5](/vault/gems/07-firmware-and-software/#75-link-loss-and-the-local-core) and
it is architectural: reflexes are loadable, and the interpretation of priorities
in an unforeseen situation is not a reflex.

A practical consequence for this layer: the log must not be trimmed to save
space during an outage. An outage is exactly when the record matters most, and a
body that discards its own unsynchronised history has made the outage
unauditable.

## 6. Open

| `⟦IMPL⟧` | Depends on |
|---|---|
| Joint current loop rate | Actuator and driver |
| Permitted inter-channel skew | Bus topology |
| Reflex stage split | Measurement on real parts |
| Thermal envelope | Packaging |
| Signing throughput, and therefore batch period | Secure element part |
