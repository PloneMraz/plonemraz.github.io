Module by module, from [`../firmware/ARCHITECTURE.md`](/vault/gems/firmware/architecture/)
down to the task. Levels L0–L5 are defined in [`README.md`](/vault/gems/plan/#levels-of-detail).

**What can start now.** Algorithms, state machines, protocol logic and their
tests do not depend on a processor. They are written against a thin hardware
abstraction and run on the host in software-in-the-loop (V-5). Only drivers,
board support and timing measurements wait for D-3.

**Scope.** Firmware as [spec 07.1](/vault/gems/07-firmware-and-software/#71-the-division)
defines it — code running directly on a microcontroller — together with the
real-time controller's modules (F-4 to F-10), which are firmware if decision D-3
selects a microcontroller and software under a real-time Linux kernel if it does
not. They are planned here either way, because their deadlines, not their layer,
decide how they are built. Capture drivers on the edge module are software and
are listed in [`software.md`](/vault/gems/plan/software/#s-9--capture-on-the-application-processor).

**One rule carried from the architecture.** Every module that carries a deadline
reports its misses. Each task below that implements a timed loop includes the
deadline monitor for it; it is not a separate task that can be skipped.
