## 1. The actuator finding — raised, and resolved

> **Resolved by option A on 2026-09-22.** The specification then declared
> **75–90 Nm/kg peak, on a peak-torque-over-module-mass basis**, and states the
> basis explicitly. **Revised 2026-09-26 to 80–90 Nm/kg** when the trunk was
> re-sized from measured human strength and gained a lateral-bend axis (§6a).
> **The arm payload came down to 15 kg the same day (§6b)**, which took `f_act`
> at 80 Nm/kg from 0.34 to 0.30; the floor stayed at 80. `spec/` and this
> document agree again; the record below is kept because the reasoning is what
> justifies a figure at the top of the commercial band. Note that the §1
> tables below were computed with the whole of `f_act` treated as scaling with
> body mass; §6b explains why only the leg and trunk part does.

Sizing the declared 30 joints against published torque densities did not
reproduce the actuator mass fraction the specification assumed. Tool output as
run on 2026-09-22, before the correction:

```
Nm/kg    mass kg    f_act    source
  22.0      155.2     1.19   integrated state of the art, whole-actuator
  33.0      103.5     0.80   the figure spec 02.6 uses
  36.0       94.8     0.73   top of the range spec 02.6 declares
  52.0       65.7     0.51   commercial QDD module, 8:1 planetary
  88.7       38.5     0.30   commercial hollow-shaft planetary module, peak
```

[Spec 02.2](/vault/gems/02-structure-and-motion/#22-the-four-coefficients)
assumes `f_act` between **0.25 and 0.35**. [Spec
02.6](/vault/gems/02-structure-and-motion/#26-actuation-and-manipulation)
declared, at that time, actuator specific torque of **30–36 Nm/kg**, and sized
its own worked example at 33.

**Those two figures were not compatible.** At 33 Nm/kg the actuators weigh 80%
of the body, `Σf` exceeds 1 before a single cell of battery is fitted, and the
coupled loop does not converge at any endurance — not at four hours, not at two.

Both figures in that paragraph have since been corrected; they are quoted here
as they stood when the contradiction was found.

### It is not the arms

Halving the per-arm payload from 30 kg to 15 kg takes the total from 3414 Nm to
3000 Nm: `f_act` falls from 0.80 to 0.70. The legs carry 1905 Nm of the total,
and leg torque is set by body mass, not by what the hands hold.

### A lighter body is worse, not better

| Body | Total torque | `f_act` at 33 Nm/kg |
|---|---|---|
| 70 kg | 2396 Nm | **1.04** |
| 90 kg | 2735 Nm | 0.92 |
| 110 kg | 3075 Nm | 0.85 |
| 130 kg | 3414 Nm | 0.80 |

Leg and waist torque scale with mass; wrist, neck and arm torques do not. Shed
mass and the fixed torques dominate a smaller budget. **There is no lighter
version of this body that closes at 33 Nm/kg.**

### What does close

The lowest density that puts `f_act` inside the assumed range is **75 Nm/kg**,
and only the best commercially claimed module reaches it. At a mainstream QDD
module's 52 Nm/kg, `f_act` = 0.51 and the loop is already marginal:

| `f_act` | 2 h | 4 h |
|---|---|---|
| 0.30 — assumed | γ = 3.2 | γ = 4.5 |
| 0.51 — at 52 Nm/kg | γ = 9.9 | γ = 81.8 |
| 0.80 — at 33 Nm/kg | **diverges** | **diverges** |

This was a decision for the author, not something to be silently patched. The
options as put are kept at §6, with the one taken marked.

## 2. Actuators

**Selection: quasi-direct drive, hollow-shaft planetary, at the top of the
commercial torque-density band.** Nothing lower closes the mass loop.

| Property | Figure | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Commercial QDD module, 8:1 planetary | **52 Nm/kg**, 9 arcmin backlash | CubeMars AKE80-8 [1] |
| Commercial hollow-shaft planetary, 16:1 | **88.7 Nm/kg** peak — 78 Nm peak, 26 Nm rated, 879 g; 78 / 0.879 = 88.7. The 85 Nm quoted here until 2026-09-26 was the end of the torque curve, see §6b | CubeMars AKH70-16 [1][22] |
| The same motor at 48:1 | **159 Nm/kg** peak — 222 Nm peak, 74 Nm rated, 1396 g, three-stage planetary; output ±5 rad/s against ±13 rad/s at 16:1 [23] | CubeMars AKH70-48 [26], search excerpts; page not readable from here |
| Highest commercial claim, series | up to **36 Nm/kg** | ZHR-H series [3] |
| Integrated SOTA, whole-actuator | **18–22 Nm/kg** — axial flux, cycloidal QDD, hybrid housing, hollow titanium shaft, phase-change cooling | [3] |
| Design floor for hip and knee | **> 30 Nm/kg** peak | [3] |
| Industrial servo, for contrast | 5–10 Nm/kg | [3] |
| QDD reduction ratios | **6:1 to 15:1**, against 50:1–120:1 industrial | [2] |
| QDD mass saving | **40–60%** against high-ratio gearboxes | [2] |

> **The two families of number.** A module advertised at 88.7 Nm/kg quotes peak
> torque over motor-plus-gearbox mass; an integrated figure of 18–22 Nm/kg
> counts housing, cooling and wiring as well. They differ by a factor of four
> and both are honest. The sizing script prints both so the gap cannot be
> read past.

**Why QDD and not harmonic drive.** [Spec
01](/vault/gems/01-architecture/#application-frame) puts safe human contact at
the core of the application frame. High-ratio harmonic drives are effectively
non-backdrivable: a stalled arm cannot yield, so contact force is whatever the
controller commands and nothing mechanical limits it. QDD at 6:1–15:1 stays
backdrivable, which makes compliance a property of the mechanism rather than a
promise made by software. That is a specification-driven reason, not a
preference.

## 3. Power

| Property | Figure | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Silicon-anode cell, commercially available | **450 Wh/kg**, 1150 Wh/L | Amprius [4] |
| Solid-state pouch, stack level | **465 Wh/kg**, 1400 Wh/L | SOLiTHOR [5] |
| Semi-solid pouch, validated | ~347 Wh/kg | [6] |
| All-solid-state pouch for robots | mass production targeted 2027, robots first | Samsung SDI [6] |
| Rate capability demonstrated | 80% retention after 400 cycles at 4C | QuantumScape [6] |

> **The durable tier of [spec 03.1](/vault/gems/03-energy/#31-source) is now
> real.** It declares 400–500 Wh/kg, and 450–465 Wh/kg cells are commercially
> available or at validated stack level. The ceiling tier at 700–1100 Wh/kg
> remains laboratory-only, exactly as the specification states.
>
> **The rate trade the specification asserts is confirmed.** The literature
> frames it as a straight choice between high C-rate and high energy density
> [7], which is the mechanism behind
> [spec 02.7](/vault/gems/02-structure-and-motion/#27-peak-power-is-limited-by-the-source-not-the-actuators):
> choosing the ceiling pack widens the peak-power shortfall rather than closing
> it.

## 4. Compute

| Property | Figure | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Edge module | NVIDIA Jetson AGX Thor | [8] |
| AI throughput | up to 2070 FP4 TFLOPS, 7.5× AGX Orin | [8][9] |
| Power | **40–130 W**, 3.5× the efficiency of AGX Orin | [8][9] |
| Memory | 128 GB | [9] |
| Interconnect | PCIe Gen 5, Blackwell architecture | [9] |

**Against the specification.** At 130 W on a 130 kg body this is **1 W/kg** —
between 4% and 10% of the 10–25 W/kg motion budget of
[spec 02.2](/vault/gems/02-structure-and-motion/#22-the-four-coefficients). Edge
compute is affordable in the power budget; what it is not is free, and
[spec 05.6](/vault/gems/05-sensing/#56-the-on-body--off-body-compute-split)
states why that matters.

The compression duty is **≥2:1 and realistically 8:1** of 15.8 Gbps raw
([spec 05.4](/vault/gems/05-sensing/#54-aggregate-rate-against-the-link)) — about
2 GB/s of sensor data processed in real time. Whether this part meets it is a
measurement, not a datasheet reading, and it stays open until measured.

## 5. Bus

**Selection: EtherCAT for the joint chain, CAN FD for distributed sensing.**

| Property | Figure | Source |
|---|---|---|
| EtherCAT in humanoids | 1 kHz (RoboSimian, Hydra, ARMAR-6) | [10] |
| | 2 kHz (Atlas, LOLA) | [10] |
| | **4 kHz** dual-channel (TOCABI) | [10] |
| CAN FD | 64-byte data field, faster data phase, CAN arbitration retained | [11] |
| Common practice | hybrid: EtherCAT for high-performance joints, CAN FD for distributed controllers | [11] |

> Boston Dynamics moved from CAN in Petman to EtherCAT in Atlas [10]. The
> balance loop needs **≥500 Hz**
> ([spec 07.2](/vault/gems/07-firmware-and-software/#72-real-time-requirements))
> and joint current loops need kHz-class service; EtherCAT at a demonstrated
> 2–4 kHz clears both with margin, and CAN FD does not.
>
> **This also bears on the timestamp requirement.** EtherCAT distributed clocks
> give the shared time base
> [spec 07.2](/vault/gems/07-firmware-and-software/#72-real-time-requirements)
> demands, rather than leaving skew to be inferred later.

## 6. The decision

The finding of §1 had no technical answer — three options, trading against each
other. They are kept here because a design that does not record what it turned
down cannot explain itself later.

| Option | What it costs | |
|---|---|---|
| **A — Raise the declared torque density to ≥75 Nm/kg** | Commits the design to the top of the commercial market. Part availability narrows sharply and there is no margin left to trade away | **✅ taken** |
| **B — Accept a higher `f_act`** | At 52 Nm/kg, `f_act` = 0.51: γ = 9.9 at two hours and 81.8 at four. Endurance collapses below two hours and the mass envelope of spec 02.5 becomes wrong | rejected |
| **C — Reduce what the body must do** | Lower peak torque means less payload, gentler gait, less dynamic recovery. The legs dominate, so this means a body that walks rather than one that catches itself | rejected on 2026-09-22 — **reopened and taken in part on 2026-09-26** for the arms only, see §6b: the 30 kg payload it was weighed against was a stress test, not the specification's group 2 capability |

### What option A committed the design to

**75–90 Nm/kg peak, over module mass — 80–90 since 2026-09-26.** Only a handful of commercial modules
reach it — the hollow-shaft planetary at 88.7 Nm/kg is at the very top of what
is claimed, and a mainstream 52 Nm/kg module does not qualify. Supply is thin
and will stay thin.

**The specification now states the basis**, which is the part that actually
prevents a repeat. The original error was not only a wrong number: 30–36 Nm/kg
is a reasonable figure *on the integrated basis*, and it was being used as if it
were peak-over-module. A density with no basis attached is a number waiting to
be misread.

**The two bands are now one constraint.** 80–90 Nm/kg maps onto `f_act`
0.30–0.34, each derivable from the other, and `scripts/gems_budget.py --check`
holds them together — including the actuator-mass column, which it did not
cover before and which is exactly where this drift hid.

## 6a. Trunk lateral-bend torque — research, 2026-09-26

Decision D-9 added a lateral-bend axis to the trunk
([kinematics §1.4](/vault/gems/hardware/kinematics/#14-the-trunk-is-a-spine-not-a-waist)). It
has no torque figure yet. Two things were found, and one was not.

**What the trunk figures already in the table rest on.** Nothing. The waist
rows — trunk pitch 1.54 Nm/kg (200 Nm at 130 kg) and trunk yaw 0.77 Nm/kg — had
no source in §7; they were assumed when the table was written. The source found
for lateral bend below covers all three axes, and has replaced both.

**Human trunk torque per kilogram, all three axes — Pan et al. 2025 [14]
(open access at the DOI; its licence is CC BY-NC-ND, so it is cited, not
vendored).** 122 asymptomatic adults, 61 male
(24.5 ± 2.3 y, 73.4 ± 15.0 kg, 175.6 ± 6.8 cm) and 61 female; Bionix Sim3 Pro
dynamometer; median peak torque, normalised to body weight:

| Axis | Isometric, male | Isometric, female | Isokinetic 15°/s, male | Isokinetic 15°/s, female |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Extension (trunk pitch) | **1.74 Nm/kg** | 1.63 | 0.69 | 1.40 |
| Flexion | 1.15 | 1.05 | 0.58 | 0.93 |
| **Lateral bending, left / right (trunk roll)** | **0.95 / 0.91** | 1.00 / 0.86 | 0.47 / 0.46 | 0.88 / 0.78 |
| Axial rotation, left / right (trunk yaw) | **0.74 / 0.64** | 0.66 / 0.66 | 0.35 / 0.40 | 0.43 / 0.53 |

Sex differences vanish once normalised (P > 0.05), so the male isometric
column is used as the figure. The isokinetic values are lower because the
device's slow constant-velocity protocol is not a peak-effort condition; they
are not a dynamic peak. Lateral bending is **0.55 × extension**.

**Cross-check, two engineered waists and one robot URDF:**

| Source | Roll : pitch | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 3-DOF coupled tendon-driven humanoid waist, *Advanced Robotics* 2023 [15]; full specification repeated in the same group's 2025 paper [19] | 0.50 | Designed pitch : roll : yaw = 4 : 2 : 1, realised as 87.0 / 53.0 / 22.2 Nm static from three RMD X8 Pro actuators of 13.0 Nm nominal each. ROM pitch −30…60°, roll ±30°, yaw ±90°. Sized for a torso surrogate of **10 kg at 0.2 m** — a ~20 Nm gravitational moment — so the absolute figures are for a light upper body; only the ratio transfers |
| Flexinoid tensegrity spine, *Scientific Reports* 2025 [18] | — | No torque figures for pitch or roll; actuators are 1.89 N·m servos with elastic assistance. Its value is as a mechanism reference — see kinematics §1.4 |
| Unitree G1 URDF, 29-DOF [16] | 1.0 | waist_roll = waist_pitch = 35 Nm, waist_yaw 88 Nm, robot 35.1 kg. An outlier: G1's pitch and roll travel only ±30°, both sized far below its yaw |

Human strength and a waist engineered to match human balance agree at
**about 0.5–0.55**. The G1 ratio is set by its small-travel design, not by need.

**Decision, 2026-09-26: option B, floor 80.** All three trunk axes take the
male isometric figures of [14]; the declared density floor of spec 02.6 moves
from 75 to 80 Nm/kg — 80 rather than the computed 78 so that the next figure
sized does not break the band again, and because 80 is the density the
shoulder-torque table of spec 02.6 already used. The band narrows to 80–90:
the design stands 10 Nm/kg, not 15, below the top of the commercial market.
The options as they were weighed, at the 130 kg point:

| | Pitch | Roll | Yaw | Σ torque | `f_act` at 75 | at 80 | at 88.7 | Density for `f_act` ≤ 0.35 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Today, no roll | 200 | — | 100 | 3414 Nm | 0.350 | 0.328 | 0.296 | 75.0 |
| **A** — add roll at 0.95 Nm/kg, keep the assumed pitch and yaw | 200 | 124 | 100 | 3537 Nm | 0.363 | 0.340 | 0.307 | **77.7** |
| **B** — all three trunk axes from [14]: 1.74 / 0.95 / 0.74 Nm/kg | 226 | 124 | 96 | 3560 Nm | 0.365 | 0.342 | 0.309 | **78.2** |

Either option moves the floor of the declared density band (spec 02.6) from
75 to about 78 Nm/kg; B also replaces two unsourced constants with sourced
ones. B was taken.

**What was not found:** a dynamic lateral trunk moment during the motions the
axis is for — twisting to protect the body in a fall, righting from the ground.
Isometric strength is a floor on capability, not a peak dynamic demand.
Asymmetric-lifting biomechanics report lateral bending moments at L5/S1 rising
with task asymmetry [17], but no peak figure was obtained.

## 6b. Arm payload and the two parts of `f_act` — 2026-09-26

**What was found.** The shoulder rows were sized for 30 kg in one hand at
0.70 m, the fingertip, and shoulder roll for 22 kg at the same lever, with the
arm's own weight left out. 30 kg one-handed with the arm straight out is above
what a strong human does; it was a stress test that had drifted into the
table, and spec 02.6 described it only as "loads in the tens of kilograms at
short to medium reach". The lever was also wrong in kind: a held object's
weight acts at the grip centre, about 0.06 m beyond the wrist, not at the
fingertip.

**Decision: 15 kg in one hand, arm straight and horizontal, load at the grip
centre; shoulder roll 11 kg in the same posture abducted.** Sized at the grip
centre — 0.64 m from the shoulder, 0.32 m from the elbow
([kinematics §2](/vault/gems/hardware/kinematics/#2-reach-and-segment-lengths)) — with the
arm's own weight added: the joint modules distal to each joint, weighed at the
floor density from their own torque in the same table, plus allowances of
0.8 kg upper-arm structure, 0.6 kg forearm structure and 0.6 kg hand that are
`⟦IMPL⟧` until CAD exists.

| Joint | Before | Payload now | Self-weight | Peak now |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Shoulder pitch | 206 Nm | 94 | 15 | **109 Nm** |
| Shoulder roll | 151 Nm | 69 | 15 | **84 Nm** |
| Elbow | 112 Nm | 47 | 5 | **52 Nm** |

The total falls from 3560 to **3112 Nm**; `f_act` at 80 Nm/kg from 0.34 to
**0.30**; the arithmetic would now allow a floor of 68 Nm/kg. **The floor stays
at 80**: the margin is kept for D-1 on the knee, for a dynamic trunk figure
above the isometric one, and for the continuous-torque question below.

**The two parts of `f_act`.** The finding of §1 that "a lighter body is
worse" and its option C were argued with the whole actuator mass treated as a
fraction of the body. It is not. Leg and trunk torque scales with body mass —
18.09 Nm per kilogram of body, 2352 Nm at 130 kg — so those actuators are a
true fraction, `f_act_s` = 0.226 at 80 Nm/kg. Arm, wrist and neck torque is
fixed by payload and geometry — 760 Nm, **9.5 kg** of actuator at 80 Nm/kg —
and is non-scaling mass, which belongs in `m_ext` of the loop beside armour
and sensors. `scripts/gems_budget.py` now takes the torque density and
carries the split; with it the 4-hour point comes out at 129.3 kg and
γ = 3.38, where the lumped model said 129.5 kg and γ = 4.5. The body mass is
the same because the fixed part was hiding inside the 0.30; the growth factor
is lower because the arms do not grow with the armour. Consequences, at the
same operating point and 15 kg payload:

| Change | Body | Hip pitch | `f_act` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reference of that morning, 4 h, 65% armour, 450 Wh/kg, 1.75 m | 129 kg | 227 Nm | 0.30 |
| Pack at 900 Wh/kg | 99 kg | 175 Nm | 0.32 |
| No armour, skin only | 99 kg | 175 Nm | 0.32 |
| Both | 76 kg | 134 Nm | 0.35 |
| **D-8 as decided that evening: 2 h with a dock, 65% armour, 1.65 m** | **96 kg** | **170 Nm** | **0.32** |

A lighter body lowers every leg and trunk module's torque and the peak power
the pack must supply, and raises `f_act` slightly because the fixed part is
divided by less body. At 30 kg payload the last row would be 0.39, outside the
band: the payload decision is what lets the body get lighter. No row brings
the hip under the 78 Nm of the one qualifying module, so D-2 is not settled
by mass.

**Where the ceiling is, on three bases.** The density band is at the top of
the market, and the market is not the ceiling:

| Tier | Figure | Basis |
|---|---|---|
| Physics | Torque is rotor volume × air-gap shear stress, and shear stress in electric machinery runs from a few kPa in small machines to about 100 kPa in very large, well-cooled ones [20]. A joint-sized motor sits at the low end; the reducer multiplies torque at the cost of its own mass | Bound, not a figure |
| Laboratory | **64.2 Nm/kg** peak — cycloidal quasi-direct drive, 89.9 Nm peak, 37.5 Nm continuous, Zhu et al. 2024 [21]; 1.40 kg by division, the paper's own mass figure not read | Peak over module mass |
| Market | **78 Nm peak, 26 Nm rated, 879 g** in the one module found at or above the floor, CubeMars AKH70-16 [22]: 78 / 0.879 = 88.7 Nm/kg, the figure the band's top rests on | Peak over module mass, as claimed |

The laboratory record is below the market claim, which is the usual sign that
the two are not on the same basis: the laboratory figure is a full module
with its housing, the market figure a compact planetary module at 16:1 whose
879 g the datasheet does not break down. **Resolved 2026-09-26 by the author
from the specification summary of the CubeMars page**: peak torque is
**78 Nm**, not the 85 Nm the search excerpts and reseller listings carried,
and 78 / 0.879 = 88.74 Nm/kg exactly. The three figures are consistent, and
the module is 7 Nm smaller than this document assumed until then — hip yaw,
at 81 Nm, and shoulder roll, at 84 Nm, moved above it.
The page's torque–speed curve at 48 VDC runs to 85 Nm, which is where the
85 figure came from; at that end the module turns at about 53 rpm and puts
out about 470 W, so its **peak specific power is about 0.53 kW/kg**, against
the 3–5 kW/kg spec 02.6 declares — an open finding for spec 02.7, where the
actuator side of the peak-power comparison rests on that band. The module's
interface is dual CAN, not EtherCAT. Price on the page: USD 598.90, recorded
in the AVL as the first verified price.

**From the manufacturer's documents, read 2026-09-26** (supplied by the
author; copyrighted, so cited and not vendored — [23][24][25]):

| Item | Figure | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Torque coefficient at the output, AKH70-16 | 2.8334 Nm/A; force-control ranges ±13 rad/s, ±110 Nm | [23] §4.2 |
| Torque coefficient at the output, AKH70-48 | 8.8123 Nm/A; ranges ±5 rad/s, ±280 Nm | [23] §4.2 |
| Drive board for both, AK70-4820-2D-A3 | 48 V rated, 18–52 V; **20 A rms rated, 60 A peak**; CAN 1 Mbps; −20…65 °C ambient, 100 °C board limit; 21-bit inner and 15-bit outer encoder; ≤1 W standby | [24] §1.1 |
| Envelope | Ø90 × 60.5 mm, Ø42 output boss, Ø7 through bore; housing mount 12 × M3 on Ø81; output face 6 × M4, 8 × M2.5, 4 × Ø3 dowels | [25] |
| AKH70-48 specification table, as far as the page shows it | 48:1, 21 pole pairs; **74 Nm rated at 28 rpm and 6 A DC** (≈ 217 W mechanical); back-drive torque 2.22 Nm; backlash 12 arcmin; NTC temperature sensor (MF51B103F3950); bearing ratings C 5680 N, C₀ 8680 N; 65 dB at 65 cm; 1396 g. The peak-torque, inertia, motor-constant and time-constant cells were blank in the copy read | [26], screenshot supplied by the author |
| Peak torque duration, thermal time constant | **not stated in any of the three documents, nor on the page.** A search engine's generated answer offering "under 0.5 s", "0.5–2 s" and "over 2 s" phases was seen and is not evidence: no CubeMars document read here gives those figures | — |

So 78 Nm at 2.83 Nm/A is 27.5 A, inside the board's 60 A peak, and the
manual's ±110 Nm command range is the drive's limit, not the motor's rating.
The thermal question of the previous paragraph stays open: the documents give
rated and peak, not how long peak may be held.

**Torque density is a ratio choice.** The AKH70-48 is the same motor and
drive behind a three-stage 48:1 reducer: 222 Nm peak, 74 Nm rated, 1396 g,
**159 Nm/kg** [26] — 1.8 times the density this document called the top of
the market, bought with output speed: ±5 rad/s against ±13 rad/s. Against
the 130 kg table of that morning, at 48:1 every leg and trunk joint was covered except hip
pitch and knee at 230 Nm (short by 8) and trunk pitch at 226 (short by 4);
at the 96 kg reference point of D-8, decided that evening, every joint is
covered, hip pitch and knee at 170 Nm with 29 kg of carry capacity to spare. What is not known is whether ~5 rad/s
at the output is enough for gait and for catching a fall; that is the
measurement D-2 now turns on, and the sizing table gains a speed column
when it exists.

**Load cases and carry capacity.** Decision D-11 of the same day limits the
declared loads to static objects and puts a held load onto the leg and trunk
rows ([spec 02.6](/vault/gems/02-structure-and-motion/#load-cases)). The
sizing script prints the case table and the mass the legs can carry against
this module's 222 Nm peak and 74 Nm rated torque; at the old 4-hour point the
body alone exceeded the peak, at the 2-hour, 1.65 m reference point of D-8
29 kg is left for the hands.

**In-house design is not an option.** By the author's rule of 2026-09-26
([`CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/PloneMraz/GEMs/blob/HEAD/CLAUDE.md) §2), no part of this design may be proposed
as something to build rather than buy. The "design them" branch of D-2 is
withdrawn; what remains is which bought module, at which ratio, and how
several combine.

**The continuous-torque gap.** Every figure in the sizing table is a peak, and
the density band is peak over module mass. The rated figures are 26 of 78 Nm
for the market module and 37.5 of 89.9 Nm for the laboratory one — about a
third. A joint that must hold its peak for longer than the module's thermal
time constant is sized by the rated figure, at roughly three times the mass.
Which joints those are — the trunk holding a lift, the shoulder holding the
declared 15 kg — is not decided here, and is the third reason the floor stays
at 80 rather than falling to 68.

Joint torque requirements used by the sizing script: ankle peak 1.4 Nm/kg at
push-off and 2.5–3.5 W/kg push-off power from normative gait data; hip
100–150 Nm peak for a 70 kg humanoid during stair climbing and squat rise,
scaled by mass [12][13]. Knee is assumed equal to hip pitch — **an assumption,
not a source**, and the one figure in the table that most deserves checking
against a real gait dataset.
