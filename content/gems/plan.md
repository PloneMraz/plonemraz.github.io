What remains between this repository and a GEMs body that is **fully written
down**: every part identified, every circuit drawn to the last passive, every
line of firmware and software written, and all of it exercised in simulation.

| Document | Contents |
|---|---|
| This file | Definition of done, the levels of detail, the open decisions, and the work packages for industrial and expressive design, mechanical, electrical, simulation and costing |
| [`firmware.md`](/vault/gems/plan/firmware/) | Firmware work, module by module, down to the task |
| [`software.md`](/vault/gems/plan/software/) | Software work, module by module, down to the task |

## 1. What "done" means here

GEMs is specified at the ceiling of current science and technology, not at the
level of a budget. **The target is a complete design, not a built body.** A
design is complete when a competent team with funding could procure, fabricate
and assemble it without making a design decision of their own.

Physical validation is out of reach and is not claimed. Verification is by
simulation — mechanical, electrical, thermal, and the full body in a physics
engine — and every simulated result says it is simulated, as
[protocol §4](/vault/gems/protocol/conformance/) already requires.

### Levels of detail

Every item in this plan is tracked against the same ladder.

| Level | Name | An item is at this level when |
|---|---|---|
| **L0** | Specified | The envelope it must meet is stated in `spec/` |
| **L1** | Architected | Its role, interfaces and budgets (mass, power, data, time) are fixed |
| **L2** | Selected | The technology or part family is chosen, with a source |
| **L3** | Identified | A manufacturer part number — or, for custom parts, a drawing number — exists, with quantity, source, and price or "quote only" |
| **L4** | Designed | Schematic and layout to every passive, CAD to every fastener, or source code that builds |
| **L5** | Verified in simulation | A simulation exercises it against its L0 envelope and the result is recorded |

**Done is L5 everywhere it can be reached, and an honest L4 everywhere else.**

### Where L3 cannot be reached

The specification admits laboratory technology where the physics exists but
the product does not (see [spec 00](/vault/gems/00-scope-and-criteria/)). For
items marked **LAB** there is no part number to identify. Their L3 is a
*reference design traced to a cited publication*, and their L4 is our own
design of whatever surrounds them — readout, drive electronics, mounting —
drawn to the same standard as everything else. The plan marks these rows so
that they cannot be mistaken for purchasable items.

---

## 2. Where the repository stands

| Subsystem | Level reached | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Envelopes, mass–energy loop | L0–L1 | `spec/`, `scripts/gems_budget.py --check` |
| Kinematics, 31 core DOF; mechanical range-of-motion targets | L1 | `hardware/kinematics.md` |
| Actuators, cells, compute, bus, materials | **L2** | `hardware/electrical/`, `hardware/mechanical/` |
| Audit log, agency tagging | **L4** in reference form | `reference/`, 30 tests |
| Firmware | L1 | `firmware/ARCHITECTURE.md` |
| Kinematic simulation model | L4 for kinematics only | `hardware/sim-model/` — inertias estimated |
| Everything else | L0 | — |

No item is at L3. The engineering BOM exists — [`hardware/bom/`](/vault/gems/hardware/bom/),
294 part numbers in a multi-level structure, with MBOM routings and an SBOM — with one selected manufacturer
part and no verified price yet.

---

## 3. Decisions that block everything else

These are ordered: each one is needed before the work packages that depend on
it can move past L2. None can be settled by arithmetic alone.

| # | Decision | Blocks | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D-1** | **Knee torque requirement.** The sizing script assumes knee = hip pitch, flagged there as an assumption, not a source | Actuator sizing, `f_act`, the mass loop | open — check against published gait data |
| **D-2** | **Actuators: which procured modules, at which reduction ratio.** In-house design is off the table by rule ([`CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/PloneMraz/GEMs/blob/HEAD/CLAUDE.md) §2, 2026-09-26): every option must be bought. The same CubeMars motor is sold at 16:1 (78 Nm peak, 105 rpm, 88.7 Nm/kg) and 48:1 (222 Nm peak, ~48 rpm, 159 Nm/kg), so torque density is a ratio choice paid in speed, and the open question per joint is *torque × speed*, not torque alone ([electrical §6b](/vault/gems/hardware/electrical/#6b-arm-payload-and-the-two-parts-of-f_act--2026-09-26)). At 48:1 only hip pitch, knee and trunk pitch fall short, by 4–8 Nm; whether ~5 rad/s at the output is enough for gait and fall recovery is unmeasured. Also settles the conflict between the per-class reducers of `hardware/mechanical` and the single module family of `hardware/electrical`, and the CAN-to-EtherCAT question of E-5 | M-3, E-3, F-3 | open — candidates in the AVL |
| **D-3** | **Real-time controller: a microcontroller under an RTOS, or an embedded computer under Linux with a real-time kernel.** The Jetson carries perception and compression; it is not the target for the 500 Hz balance loop and the 10 ms reflex path. The choice decides whether that code is firmware or software (spec 07.1), and how its latency bound is established — by construction or by measurement | All firmware, E-5 | open |
| **D-4** | **High-voltage bus voltage** | Every power stage, cell count in series, harness gauge | open |
| **D-5** | **Cell and pack format** at the durable tier (400–500 Wh/kg) | Pack mechanics, BMS, thermal | open — candidates sourced in `hardware/electrical/` |
| **D-6** | **Reference hand configuration.** The declaration leaves 2×5 to 2×21 DOF open (`⟦CTRL⟧`); a complete design needs one point to draw | M-4, E-3 count, F-3 count | open — anchor figure is 40 joints, i.e. 2×5 |
| **D-7** | **Secure element and low-power beacon radio** | Attestation, beacon, C-10, C-11 | open |
| **D-8** | **Operating point for the reference design** — endurance, height, armour | Mass, pack size, every downstream figure | **decided 2026-09-26, in part: 2 h free-running with a dock, and 1.65 m** (was 4 h, 1.75 m). The body comes to ~96 kg and the legs gain 29 kg of carry capacity against the AKH70-48 ([spec 02.6](/vault/gems/02-structure-and-motion/#load-cases)). Open within it: armour coverage and level — the reference keeps 65% until discussed. The dock is now load-bearing for the design: package DK |
| **D-9** | **Trunk architecture** | M-5, E-3, F-5, the URDF | **decided 2026-09-26: a coupled multi-segment spine** — three segments, one actuator per axis for yaw, pitch and lateral bend ([kinematics §1.4](/vault/gems/hardware/kinematics/#14-the-trunk-is-a-spine-not-a-waist)). Open within it: the coupling mechanism and ratios. All three trunk axes are sized from Pan et al. 2025 |
| **D-10** | **Arm payload** | Shoulder and elbow sizing, `f_act`, the mass loop | **decided 2026-09-26: 15 kg in one hand, arm horizontal, load at the grip centre; shoulder roll 11 kg** ([electrical §6b](/vault/gems/hardware/electrical/#6b-arm-payload-and-the-two-parts-of-f_act--2026-09-26)). Replaced a 30 kg fingertip stress test. With it `f_act` splits into a scaling part (legs, trunk) and a fixed part (arms, wrists, neck) carried in `m_ext`; the density floor stays at 80 Nm/kg as margin |
| **D-11** | **Load cases** | Leg and trunk sizing, carry capacity, D-8 | **decided 2026-09-26: static objects only; lifting, carrying or dragging a person is out, contact stays in** ([spec 02.6](/vault/gems/02-structure-and-motion/#load-cases)). A held load adds to the leg and trunk per-kg rows. Open within it: the masses of the four proposed cases |

D-6 and D-8 are choices of *which* point to draw, not changes to the
specification: the specification keeps its ranges, and a reference design
declares the one it drew.

## 4. Work packages

Every package lists its tasks, the level it takes its subject to, and what it
waits for. IDs are stable so that commits and issues can name them.

### ID — Industrial and expressive design

How the body looks, and how it can show things. Two halves that share one
surface: the **form** — proportion, silhouette, colour, material and finish —
and the **expressive capability** — face, gaze and posture as a set of
controllable degrees of freedom with ranges and speeds.

**Scope boundary kept.** This package specifies what the body *can* express,
never *when* or *why* it does. Choosing an expression is the controller's, and
the controller is not specified here ([README](/vault/gems/body/#scope-boundary)).

Two standard references anchor it. The **Facial Action Coding System** (Ekman
and Friesen, 1978) is the vocabulary for facial movement, and robot heads have
been designed around its action units [Yan et al., 2014](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1155/2014/208924).
The **uncanny valley** (Mori) is the design risk: a face that nearly but not
quite passes as human is received worse than one that does not try.

| ID | Task | To | Waits for |
|---|---|---|---|
| ID-1 | Design brief: proportions from `kinematics.md`, the gynoid form, the uncanny-valley position the design takes and why; starting from the author's [concept art](/vault/gems/hardware/design/concept/) and its tensions with the specification | L1 | — |
| ID-2 | Form development: silhouette and proportion studies, form language, then class-A outer surfaces in CAD. Constraints: shell thickness (spec 04.5), armour coverage (spec 02.4), joint range of motion from the URDF | L4 | ID-1, M-1 |
| ID-3 | Human-contact surfaces: pinch-point elimination at every joint, contact zones for safe touch (spec 01 group 4), lift and handling points | L4 | ID-2 |
| ID-4 | Colour, material and finish by zone, within what the shell layers allow: electrochromic range (spec 04.3), the sense-and-heal skin's feel, the fire layer's constraints | L4 | ID-2, M-8 — **LAB** in part |
| ID-5 | Face: static geometry, eyes, skin; the FACS action units the face will actuate, which fixes the count of facial actuators (EBOM `GEM-11090`) | L4 | ID-1 — **LAB** |
| ID-6 | Expressive capability specification: range, speed and simultaneity per action unit; gaze from neck and eyes; posture; colour change as a slow channel | L4 | ID-5 |
| ID-7 | Visual model: renders and a textured visual model for the simulator, replacing the primitives of `sim-model/` | L4 | ID-2 |
| ID-8 | Evaluation without hardware: a rendered-stimulus perception study protocol for the face and form — the protocol and stimuli are in scope, running it needs people | L5 | ID-6, ID-7 |

### M — Mechanical

| ID | Task | To | Waits for |
|---|---|---|---|
| M-1 | Parametric CAD skeleton generated from `kinematics.md`, the same way the URDF is — joint frames, segment envelopes, keep-out volumes | L4 | — |
| M-2 | Packaging study: where the pack, compute, drives, radios and sensors sit, checked against segment envelopes, the outer form and the centre of mass. **Pack location decided: the scapular region of the upper back, on the torso frame** — see [pack location](#pack-location-decided) below | L1 | D-4, D-5, ID-2 |
| M-3 | Joint modules per class — hip/knee (cycloidal), shoulder/elbow (QDD planetary), wrist/neck (harmonic): bearings, seals, encoder mounts, joint locks (spec 03.2 measure 4), series-elastic elements (measure 5) | L4 | D-1, D-2 |
| M-4 | Hands at the reference configuration | L4 | D-6 |
| M-5 | Structure per segment — composite tubes, 7075 load-introduction fittings, fastener schedule | L4 | M-2, M-3 |
| M-6 | Structural FEA per segment against peak joint loads and a fall case | L5 | M-5 |
| M-7 | Protection layer — integrated multi-threat package, panel layout at the declared coverage | L4 | D-8 |
| M-8 | Shell, three layers (spec 04.5): sense-and-heal, variable stiffness, load-and-fire, on the surfaces of ID-2 | L4 | M-7, ID-2 — **LAB** for the first two |
| M-9 | Head and sensor mounting — stereo baseline, thermal, LiDAR, microphone array geometry, inside the face of ID-5 | L4 | E-6, ID-5 |
| M-10 | Dock, mechanical — moved to package DK below | — | — |
| M-11 | Thermal design — conduction paths, compute and drive cooling, sealed-body dissipation. Exhaust at the upper back, over the pack — see [pack location](#pack-location-decided) below | L5 | M-2, E-3, E-5 |
| M-12 | Mass properties exported from CAD into the simulation model, replacing the estimated inertias | L5 | M-5 |

#### Pack location, decided

The author's decision, 2026-09-26: **the battery pack sits in the scapular
region of the upper back, on the torso frame** — not on the arms, and not in the
waist or pelvis. It frees the waist the concept art asks for
([`hardware/design/concept/`](/vault/gems/hardware/design/concept/)), and it places the
body's largest heat source where an exhaust is easiest to design.

What the decision costs, at the declared point (URDF geometry at 1.65 m: pelvis centre
~0.94 m above the sole, scapular region ~1.30 m), and how the cost falls as
cells improve — `gems_budget.py` at the D-8 point, 2 h and 65% coverage:

| Cell energy density | Body | Pack | Centre of mass raised by moving the pack from pelvis to upper back |
|---|---|---|---|
| 450 Wh/kg — durable tier, today | 96.2 kg | 8.5 kg, 3.9 kWh | ~3 cm |
| 550 Wh/kg | 92.3 kg | 6.7 kg | ~3 cm |
| 700 Wh/kg — low end of the ceiling tier (spec 03.1) | 88.9 kg | 5.1 kg | ~2 cm |
| 1000 Wh/kg | 85.3 kg | 3.4 kg | ~1 cm |

(At the 4 h point this section was written for, the pack was 23 kg and the
shift ~6 cm; the move to 2 h on 2026-09-26 took most of the cost away.)

The pack shrinks faster than the energy it holds would suggest, because the
mass loop compounds: a lighter pack makes a lighter body, which needs less pack.
Two things do not improve with it. The ceiling tier trades rate for density
(spec 02.7, 03.1), so the peak-power shortfall widens; and its cycle life is
presently ~100 cycles. A denser cell is not free — it moves the problem.

Constraints the decision carries into the design:

| | |
|---|---|
| **Trunk load** | Pack mass high above the waist adds pitch inertia about the waist (~0.7 kg·m² at 8.5 kg, against ~3.7 kg·m² estimated for the 1.75 m torso — under +20%; ~1.8 kg·m² and +50% at the 23 kg pack of the old 4 h point). Trunk pitch, 167 Nm at the reference point, is sized with it; the pack rides the top spine segment, so the spine turns beneath it |
| **Impact protection** | A pack frame with a crush zone between the outer shell and the cells, so that an impact reaches the cells as shock within their qualified level, never as deformation or penetration — the path to thermal runaway. The upper back has the volume for that crush zone; the waist, in the concept's form, does not |
| **Falls** | The upper back is among the first regions to land in a backward fall, at speed. **Verification requirement (V-4):** the pack survives the worst-case backward fall from standing with no cell deformation and cell acceleration within the qualified shock level. The supported failure state (spec 07.3 g2) should still favour falls that spare the back |
| **Strikes** | The flank and waist are primary targets for kicks and knees; many combat rule sets forbid strikes to the spine and the back of the head. The upper back is the least-struck region of the torso |
| **Dock** | The default dock is a seat carrying the body through the pelvis (spec 03.5). A pack in the upper back is never loaded by sitting, and the charging contacts can sit in the backrest, next to the pack |
| **Cooling exhaust** | Up and out at the upper back, where warm air leaves naturally; intake low. Exhaust points away from the face and head sensors |
| **Thermal-runaway venting** | A separate path from cooling, and never toward the head. Runaway gas is directed down and away from the body |
| **Sealing and armour** | Openings in the torso break the seal and the armour; the torso is in every coverage band (spec 02.4). Baffled or labyrinth openings behind the protection layer |
| **Compute placement** | The edge module (40–130 W) is not placed upstream of the cells in the airflow — cells keep a lower temperature window than compute |

### E — Electrical

| ID | Task | To | Waits for |
|---|---|---|---|
| E-1 | System block diagram: every board, every bus, every power rail, every connector | L1 | D-3, D-4 |
| E-2 | Power: pack, BMS, pre-charge and contactor, fusing, supercapacitor tier (spec 03.2 measure 3), regeneration path, dock charger interface | L4 | D-4, D-5 |
| E-3 | Joint drive board: inverter, gate driver, phase current sensing, encoder interface, EtherCAT slave controller, temperature sensing, brake and lock driver | L4 | D-2, D-4 |
| E-4 | Power distribution and conversion: HV to logic rails, isolated domains, the always-on rail at quiescent power (spec 03.6) | L4 | E-2 |
| E-5 | Compute boards: Jetson carrier, real-time controller board, EtherCAT master interface, storage for the audit log | L4 | D-3 |
| E-6 | Sensor front-ends: camera links, thermal, LiDAR, microphone array, SDR, IMUs, e-nose | L4 | E-5 |
| E-7 | Tactile skin readout for ~460,000 taxels (spec 05.2): multiplexing, ADCs, local event compression | L4 | **LAB** |
| E-8 | Radios: mmWave uplink, fallback link, low-power beacon radio | L4 | D-7 |
| E-9 | Root of trust: secure element per node or per bus segment | L4 | D-7 |
| E-10 | Shell drivers: magnetorheological coils or electrorheological high-voltage supply, electrochromic drivers | L4 | M-8 — **LAB** |
| E-11 | Contact-amplitude instrumentation (spec 06.6) | L4 | E-7 |
| E-12 | Harness: every cable, gauge, connector, length, routed through the CAD | L4 | M-5, E-1 |
| E-13 | Circuit simulation: power stages, gate drive, current sensing, rail sequencing, in SPICE | L5 | E-2 … E-4 |
| E-14 | Power and energy budget rebuilt from part datasheets, checked against spec 02 and 03 | L5 | E-2 … E-10 |

### F — Firmware

See [`firmware.md`](/vault/gems/plan/firmware/). Waits for D-3 to reach L4; the parts that do
not depend on a target — algorithms, state machines, protocols — can be written
now and run in simulation.

### S — Software

See [`software.md`](/vault/gems/plan/software/). Needs no hardware decision and can proceed now.

### V — Simulation and verification

| ID | Task | To | Waits for |
|---|---|---|---|
| V-1 | Full-body physics model with actuator models (torque–speed, current limits, reducer efficiency, backlash) | L5 | M-12, D-2 |
| V-2 | Battery and power model: state of charge, voltage sag at peak draw, the 5C peak of spec 02.7 | L5 | E-2 |
| V-3 | Balance and gait in simulation at ≥ 500 Hz, driven by the firmware's own controller code | L5 | F-5 |
| V-4 | Fall and supported failure state (C-16), including the backward-fall case for the pack (see [pack location](#pack-location-decided)) | L5 | F-8 |
| V-5 | Software-in-the-loop: firmware built for the host, stepping against the physics model | L5 | F-0 |
| V-6 | Emulated target: firmware built for the real processor, run in an instruction-set emulator against the physics model | L5 | D-3 |
| V-7 | Sensor simulation: rendered cameras, depth, IMU noise, tactile contact, for the software pipeline | L5 | S-1 |
| V-8 | Link simulation: bandwidth, latency, outage, for link management | L5 | S-5 |
| V-9 | Conformance re-assessment: rerun `protocol/assess.py` with each simulated result, and state which rows moved and why | L5 | all |

### DK — Dock

With the reference point at 2 h free-running (D-8), the dock is part of the
design, not an accessory: the body's day is a sequence of free-running spans
and dock returns, and nothing in the repository designs the dock yet. Spec
[03.5](/vault/gems/03-energy/#35-dock) declares its forms (seat or couch by
default, load-bearing hanger for storage) and both charging methods; the
pack-location decision above puts the contacts in the backrest.

| ID | Task | To | Waits for |
|---|---|---|---|
| DK-1 | Requirements: charge power and time to full against the 3.9 kWh pack, how many returns a day at the declared power profile, wired and wireless roles (spec 03.5), where a body may dock, what state it holds while docked (spec 03.4 levels 3 and 4) | L1 | D-8 |
| DK-2 | Seat form: pelvis support and rise-from-seat path against the ROM tiers, backrest contacts beside the pack, alignment and self-docking tolerance, the hanger variant | L4 | DK-1, ID-2, M-2 |
| DK-3 | Dock electrical: charger, contact set and its safety (dead contacts until mated), wireless pad as the maintenance path, thermal handling of charge power, mains side | L4 | DK-1, D-4, D-5, E-2 |
| DK-4 | Dock-side control and telemetry: detection and handshake with F-9, charge control, the beacon read while docked (spec 06.5) | L4 | DK-3, F-9 |
| DK-5 | Simulated dock cycle: walk to dock, sit, charge, rise — endurance per day measured, not assumed | L5 | V-3, DK-2 |

### B — Bill of materials and cost

| ID | Task | To | Waits for |
|---|---|---|---|
| B-1 | BOM format: part, manufacturer, part number, quantity, source link, unit price, currency, date priced, maturity — ✅ [`hardware/bom/`](/vault/gems/hardware/bom/): EBOM, MBOM, SBOM, item master, AVL | — | — |
| B-2 | Price what is already selected at L2 — actuator modules, cells, compute, EtherCAT and CAN FD parts, materials | L3 | B-1 |
| B-3 | Extend the BOM as each work package reaches L3 | L3 | each package |
| B-4 | Cost roll-up by subsystem, with "quote only" and **LAB** rows counted separately rather than guessed | L3 | B-3 |

Prices are recorded with the date they were read and the page they were read
from. A price that could not be found is left empty and says so.

## 5. Order of work

Nothing here waits for money. What waits is decisions.

1. **D-1**, the knee torque, first — it is the one open figure that could stop
   the mass loop from converging, and it is cheap to settle.
2. **D-2 to D-5**, with **B-2** alongside, because pricing the candidates is
   part of choosing between them.
3. **S** work in parallel from now: it needs no hardware. **ID-1** and **ID-5**
   can start now as well — the brief and the face depend on the kinematics and
   the specification, not on parts.
4. **M-1**, **E-1**, **ID-2**, and the target-independent parts of **F**, once
   D-3 and D-4 are settled. Form and packaging iterate against each other from
   here: neither is fixed first.
5. Detailed design — M-3 to M-11, E-2 to E-12, F source against the target.
6. Verification — V-1 to V-9 — as each piece reaches L4, not at the end.
