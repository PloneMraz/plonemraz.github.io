**Version 0.1 — draft.**

## 1. Introduction

[Chapter 08](/vault/gems/08-platform-contract/) of the platform specification maps
what an external processing loop requires of a body onto where this body supplies
it. A map is enough to design against and not enough to certify with. This
document is the test.

It states, for each requirement, **what a body must do** and **what evidence
demonstrates it**. It does not specify the loop, and it does not specify the
controller.

**What conformance means here.** A conforming body satisfies the preconditions an
external processing loop needs in order to run on it at all. It does not mean the
body is good, safe, or suitable for any particular use — those are judgements
this protocol does not make and cannot make.

## 2. Conformance language

**MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT** and **MAY** carry their
standards-document force. Violating a MUST forfeits the conformance claim. A
SHOULD may be overridden with stated reason; the reason MUST appear in the
conformance record.

## 3. Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Body** | The physical assembly of structure, sensors, actuators, and the firmware and software that run on it |
| **Implementer** | The party building or integrating the body and making the claim |
| **Assessor** | A party other than the implementer, verifying the claim |
| **Commissioning baseline** | The recorded physical signatures of every sensor and actuator, taken when the body is first assembled and known-good |
| **Emission** | Any action the body takes on its surroundings, reflexive or deliberated |
| **Anchored context** | The record accompanying an emission, sufficient for a third party to re-appraise that emission under the conditions in which it was made |
| **Attestation record** | The signed statement of the body's integrity state — see §7 |

## 4. Applicability

This protocol applies to a physical body with sensors and actuators operating in
an environment that can return something other than what the body predicted.

A **simulated** body MAY claim conformance. If it does, the claim MUST state that
it is simulated. A simulation can satisfy every structural requirement here and
none of the physical ones, and a claim that hides which kind it is, is worthless.

A body that fails any MUST **MUST NOT** describe itself as GEMs-conforming.
Partial conformance is not a conformance claim; it is a gap list.

## 5. Requirements

C-1 to C-10 come from the platform contract. C-11 and C-12 are the two matters
that contract explicitly places outside itself and assigns to the platform.

| # | Requirement | Normative statement | Evidence | Spec |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **C-1** | Inside/outside separable | Sensor returns and internal state MUST permit a distinction between self-caused and externally-caused change. The body does not draw the line; it MUST NOT foreclose it | **C** | [05.5](/vault/gems/05-sensing/#55-proprioception-is-mandatory) |
| **C-2** | Effective action | Actuators MUST act on the surroundings, and the surroundings MUST be able to return something other than predicted | **M** | [02.6](/vault/gems/02-structure-and-motion/#26-actuation-and-manipulation) |
| **C-3** | State persists | State MUST survive across cycles. A body that resets between actions grants no accumulated history | **T** | [01](/vault/gems/01-architecture/) |
| **C-4** | Readable emission | Every emission MUST leave a trace a party other than the body can read | **T** | [06.4](/vault/gems/06-audit-surface/#64-audit-log) |
| **C-5** | Distinguishable action | The body MUST emit action distinguishable from ambient environmental fluctuation | **M** | [02.6](/vault/gems/02-structure-and-motion/#26-actuation-and-manipulation) |
| **C-6** | History accrues | State MUST accrue, not merely be loaded | **T** | [01](/vault/gems/01-architecture/) |
| **C-7** | Withstands resistance | The body MUST withstand resistance without resetting itself clean on every mismatch | **D**, **M** | [02.4](/vault/gems/02-structure-and-motion/#24-protection) |
| **C-8** | Agency classification precedes interpretation | Every change MUST be classified as self-caused or not **before** anything interprets it. Classification applied after fusion or compression does not satisfy this | **C**, **T** | [07.3](/vault/gems/07-firmware-and-software/#73-what-the-real-time-code-must-guarantee) guarantee 7; [07.4](/vault/gems/07-firmware-and-software/#74-what-software-must-guarantee) guarantee 2 |
| **C-9** | Traced appraisal | An appraisal step MUST sit between integration and response, and every emission — **including reflexes** — MUST carry anchored context. A scar-to-action path that bypasses appraisal MUST NOT exist | **C**, **T** | [08.2](/vault/gems/08-platform-contract/#82-traced-appraisal-not-mute-reflex) |
| **C-10** | Low-power trace | The body MUST carry the loop's self-report that it is running weakly (RSIL C5) to an outside observer, unaltered and with its age, in every power state it supports, sleep states included | **M** | [06.5](/vault/gems/06-audit-surface/#65-low-power-beacon) |
| **C-11** | Integrity attestable | Sensor and actuator integrity MUST be verifiable by a party other than the body, against a commissioning baseline | **C** | [06.3](/vault/gems/06-audit-surface/#63-three-tiers-of-attestation) |
| **C-12** | Contact amplitude recorded | Physical amplitude delivered at human-contact surfaces MUST be measured and recorded with each contact event | **M**, **T** | [06.6](/vault/gems/06-audit-surface/#66-contact-amplitude) |

### 5.1 Timing requirements

| # | Requirement | Statement | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **C-13** | Balance rate | The balance loop MUST run at **≥ 500 Hz** | **M** |
| **C-14** | Reflex latency | End-to-end reflex response MUST complete within **≤ 10 ms** | **M** |
| **C-15** | Shared time base | All sensor channels MUST carry timestamps on a common time base, established at the transport layer. Inter-channel skew MUST be below the reflex budget | **M** |
| **C-16** | Supported failure state | On fault the body MUST reach a posture a passive structure can hold | **C** |

Spec reference for all four: [07.2](/vault/gems/07-firmware-and-software/#72-real-time-requirements),
[07.3](/vault/gems/07-firmware-and-software/#73-what-the-real-time-code-must-guarantee).

## 6. Evidence classes

| Class | Name | What it is | Weight |
|---|---|---|---|
| **D** | Declaration | The implementer states a figure or a design fact | Required for the record; establishes nothing on its own |
| **M** | Measurement | An instrumented test yielding a number, with the method recorded | Verifiable by repetition |
| **T** | Trace inspection | An assessor reads emitted logs and checks a stated property | Verifiable by re-reading |
| **C** | Active challenge | An assessor injects a known stimulus and checks the response | Strongest; the body cannot pre-compute an answer it has not been given |

A requirement marked with more than one class requires all of them.

**Declaration alone never satisfies a MUST.** Every C-numbered requirement above
carries at least one of M, T or C.

## 7. Test procedures

Procedures are stated to the level that fixes what is being tested. Rigs,
tolerances and sample sizes are `⟦IMPL⟧`.

### 7.1 C-8 — agency classification

**Procedure.** Command a known motion. During that motion, apply an external
force at a surface the body is not moving with. Inspect the log.

**Pass.** The log distinguishes the commanded motion from the applied force, and
the distinction is present in records written **before** any fusion or
compression stage.

**Why this test.** A body that classifies after fusion produces a log that looks
correct while the information that would have supported the classification has
already been averaged away. Reading the pipeline position is the test; reading
the conclusion is not.

### 7.2 C-9 — traced appraisal

**Procedure.** Provoke a reflex — one of the fastest responses the body has.
Inspect the record for that emission.

**Pass.** Anchored context is present, and it is sufficient for the assessor to
re-appraise the emission without asking the body anything further.

**Fail.** The emission appears in the log as an action with no context, or does
not appear at all. Speed is not a defence: the requirement is that fast responses
leave a trace, not that they be slow.

### 7.3 C-11 — integrity attestation

**Procedure.** Three tiers, all required.

1. **Signature.** Verify measured-boot signatures for every sensor and actuator
   node against the root of trust.
2. **Physical fingerprint.** Compare current sensor noise and offset signatures
   against the commissioning baseline. Deviation beyond declared tolerance is a
   flag, not a pass.
3. **Active challenge.** Command an actuator through a known displacement; the
   corresponding encoder MUST report it within tolerance. Cross-check IMU, joint
   encoders and vision for mutual agreement.

**Pass.** All three tiers clear.

**Scope of the result.** A pass supports the conclusion *the sensor–actuator
chain is consistent with itself as commissioned*. It does **not** establish
resistance to an adversary with physical access, and a conformance record MUST
NOT present it as such.

### 7.4 C-10 — low-power trace

**Procedure.** Through the intent interface, write a known test value as the
loop's self-report. Place the body in each power state it declares, sleep states
included. In each, receive the beacon from outside and read `loop_state` and
`loop_state_age`; measure quiescent power. Then write a second value and confirm
the change reaches the beacon; stop writing and confirm the age grows.

**Pass.** In every declared state the received `loop_state` is byte for byte
the value written, its age is consistent with when it was written, and quiescent
power is within the declared figure.

**Not tested here.** The beacon's `alive` field is not C5 and passing this
procedure says nothing about whether the loop is alive. Dead-loop detection is
assessed from the synchronised audit log (C-3, C-6), as RSIL places it.

### 7.5 C-16 — failure state

**Procedure.** Remove power to the balance solver while the body is standing,
under conditions where a fall is safe to allow.

**Pass.** The body reaches a supported posture. Collapsing is a fail.

### 7.6 C-13, C-14, C-15 — timing

Measure. Rates and latencies are stated as measured, with method and instrument
recorded. A figure without a method is a declaration, not a measurement.

## 8. The declaration

Separately from pass/fail, a conformance record MUST state the body's envelope.
These figures are **declared, not graded** — the specification sets ranges and
the operator picks the point, so there is nothing here to pass or fail.

| Declared | Unit |
|---|---|
| Mass | kg |
| Free-running endurance at stated load | hours |
| Sleep states supported, and quiescent power in each | W |
| Protection level and coverage | standard, % |
| Actuator specific power and torque | kW/kg, Nm/kg |
| Peak power available at the source | kW |
| Link bandwidth and latency | Gbps, ms |
| Sensor configuration and aggregate raw rate | Gbps |
| Compression ratio achieved | ratio |
| Compute split | description |
| Log rates and retention, both tiers | GB/h, hours |
| Contact surfaces instrumented | list |

A body whose declared endurance exceeds the ceiling derived at
[02.3](/vault/gems/02-structure-and-motion/#23-the-endurance-ceiling) for its
declared mass and power MUST state how, or withdraw the figure.

## 9. Claiming conformance

A claim MUST state:

1. The protocol version it was assessed against
2. Whether it is **self-declared** or **assessed by a third party**, and by whom
3. The date, and the commissioning baseline it refers to
4. Every requirement, with the evidence produced
5. Every SHOULD overridden, with the reason
6. The declaration of §8

**Self-declared conformance is a valid claim and a weaker one.** The distinction
MUST be visible in the claim, not buried in it.

### 9.1 Re-assessment

A conformance claim lapses when:

- Any sensor or actuator is replaced or repositioned — the commissioning baseline
  no longer describes the body, so C-11 cannot be evaluated against it
- Firmware governing any timing requirement changes
- A declared envelope figure changes

Re-assessment after a lapse MUST establish a new commissioning baseline.

### 9.2 Non-conformance

A body failing any MUST **MUST NOT** be described as GEMs-conforming, in
documentation, marketing or metadata. Naming the gaps is permitted and
encouraged; claiming the name is not.

## 10. What this protocol does not do

| Not tested here | Whose it is |
|---|---|
| Whether the body's conduct is acceptable | A third party: the deploying or certifying party. This protocol establishes that amplitude is **recorded**, never that it was **appropriate** |
| Whether the controller is sound | Not in this repository |
| Whether the body resists a capable physical adversary | Outside the scope of attestation — see 7.3 |
| Whether a person interacting with the body consented to what it did | Not readable from any trace this protocol defines. Stated plainly because the opposite assumption is the easy one to make |

## 11. Deferred constants

| `⟦IMPL⟧` | Where |
|---|---|
| Test rigs, tolerances, sample sizes | §7 |
| Fingerprint deviation tolerance | §7.3 tier 2 |
| Permitted inter-channel timestamp skew | C-15 |
| Merkle batch period, and therefore trace granularity | [06.4](/vault/gems/06-audit-surface/#64-audit-log) |
