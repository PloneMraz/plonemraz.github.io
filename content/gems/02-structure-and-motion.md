Structure, actuation and energy are one coupled loop. They cannot be specified
separately, and cutting the loop anywhere leaves the other ends meaningless.

> Every figure in this chapter is reproducible:

## 2.1 The mass loop

Body mass divides into two kinds:

- **Scaling mass** — structure, actuators, battery. The heavier the body, the
  more of each it needs, because they exist to carry and move that very mass.
- **Non-scaling mass** — armour, compute, sensors, hands, skin, harness. These
  are placed on the body from outside; their size is set by the mission, not by
  the body's mass.

With `m` the total mass and `m_ext` the non-scaling part:

```
m  =  f_str·m  +  f_act·m  +  f_bat·m  +  m_ext

     f_bat = p·t / e
     p = specific power in motion (W/kg)
     t = required free-running endurance (hours)
     e = battery energy density (Wh/kg)
```

Solving:

```
m  =  m_ext / (1 − Σf)      where  Σf = f_str + f_act + p·t/e
γ  =  1 / (1 − Σf)          — the growth factor
```

**Convergence condition: `Σf < 1`.**

This is a structural statement, not a design point. If the three scaling terms
sum to the whole body, nothing is left for armour, sensors or hands — and **no
mass satisfies the system, at any price**. Such a design is not heavy; it does
not exist.

`γ` reads directly as **the mass price of each kilogram of function**: adding
1 kg of armour costs not 1 kg but `γ` kg of body.

## 2.2 The four coefficients

| Coefficient | Range | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `f_str` — structure | ~0.25–0.35 | `⟦IMPL⟧` — material and safety factor |
| `f_act` — actuators | ~0.25–0.35 | Derived, not assumed: the summed joint torque of the declared kinematics divided by actuator torque density, in two parts — see below and [2.6](#26-actuation-and-manipulation) |
| `p` — specific power | **~10–25 W/kg** in motion | *Sourced* — commercial humanoids draw 300–1500 W walking; a 2.3 kWh pack supporting ~2 h of dynamic work implies ~1.1 kW continuous. Armoured bodies sit in the upper half |
| `e` — battery density | **450** (durable) / **900** (ceiling) Wh/kg | [03](/vault/gems/03-energy/) |

`f_str` is left open because it depends on material choices not yet made; its
range is narrow enough that no conclusion below changes sign.

`f_act` is **no longer an assumption**. It follows from the declared joint count
and the declared torque density, and 2.6 shows the derivation. It is listed as a
coefficient because the loop consumes it as one, not because it is free.

**It has two parts, and the loop treats them differently.** Leg and trunk
torque scales with body mass, so their actuators are a true fraction of the
body: `f_act_s` = **0.226** at 80 Nm/kg, and this is the part that enters `Σf`.
Arm, wrist and neck torque is fixed by payload and geometry, not by body mass,
so their actuators are non-scaling mass — **9.2 kg** at 80 Nm/kg — and enter
`m_ext` beside armour and sensors, where `γ` multiplies them. The `f_act` of the
table is the sum of both over the body, 0.32 at the 2-hour point. Treating the
whole of it as scaling, as this section did before 2026-09-26, overstated `γ`
and made a lighter body look worse than it is.

## 2.3 The endurance ceiling

Setting `Σf = 1` and solving for `t`:

```
t_max  =  (1 − f_str − f_act) · e / p
```

Here `f_act` is the scaling part of 2.2, `f_act_s` = 0.226 at 80 Nm/kg; the
fixed part sits in `m_ext` and does not bound `t`. At `f_str` = 0.30:

| | `p`=10 | `p`=15 | `p`=20 | `p`=25 W/kg |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **e = 450** Wh/kg | 21.3 h | 14.2 h | **10.7 h** | 8.5 h |
| **e = 900** Wh/kg | 42.6 h | 28.4 h | **21.3 h** | 17.1 h |

And `γ` inflates sharply on approach (`e`=450):

| `p` \ `t` | 2 h | 4 h | 6 h | 8 h | 10 h |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10 W/kg | 2.3 | 2.6 | 2.9 | 3.4 | 4.0 |
| 15 W/kg | 2.5 | 2.9 | 3.7 | 4.8 | 7.1 |
| **20 W/kg** | 2.6 | 3.4 | 4.8 | **8.5** | 34.0 |
| 25 W/kg | 2.8 | 4.0 | 7.1 | 34.0 | *diverges* |

> **Read this correctly.** It does not say the body runs for 10 hours. It says
> that at `p`=20 W/kg on a durable-grade pack, **no free-running body beyond
> 10.7 hours exists** — and that from about 8 hours the price is already
> meaningless, since γ=8.5 means each kilogram of armour costs 8.5 kg of body.
>
> Endurance remains `⟦CTRL⟧`. What this ceiling adds is a bound the controller
> cannot choose past, because on the far side there is no expensive design —
> there is no design.

## 2.4 Protection

The group 5 standard is one material level covering handgun rounds, knives and
everyday impact together. Bullets and blades defeat armour by different
mechanisms — a blade tip passes between soft fibres where a bullet does not — so
a single body facing both needs a multi-layer package.

| Layer | Areal density | Note |
|---|---|---|
| Ballistic, NIJ IIIA (soft UHMWPE/aramid) | **3.8–5.6 kg/m²** | lightest ~3.76; typical ~4.9; aramid hybrid ~5.6 |
| Stab, NIJ 0115 level 1 (spike) | **~3.2 kg/m²** standalone | |
| **Integrated multi-threat package** | **~6–9 kg/m²** | cheaper than adding two layers, dearer than one |

*Sourced.* Against a skin area of ~1.6 m² for a 1.65 m body (1.8 m² at the
1.75 m declared until 2026-09-26, scaled by the square of height):

| Coverage | Area | @6 kg/m² | @9 kg/m² |
|---|---|---|---|
| 50% — torso and head | 0.80 m² | 4.8 kg | 7.2 kg |
| 65% — plus outer limbs | 1.04 m² | 6.2 kg | 9.4 kg |
| 80% — near full body | 1.28 m² | 7.7 kg | 11.5 kg |

> Armour is non-scaling mass, so it enters `m_ext` and is multiplied by `γ`. At
> γ=2.6, the reference point, choosing 80% coverage over 50% adds ~3 kg of armour — and **~7 kg of
> body**. Coverage and level are under discussion (D-8): the reference design
> keeps 65% until that is settled. This is where the trade bites hardest, and it is `⟦CTRL⟧`.
>
> Rifle-rated protection (NIJ III/IV) is achievable but adds substantially more
> mass. The anchor level proposed here is handgun plus blade plus everyday
> impact; anything above is `⟦CTRL⟧`.

## 2.5 Mass envelope

`m = γ · m_ext`, with `m_ext` = armour (5–13 kg) plus fixed mass — compute,
sensors, hands, skin, harness: **15–25 kg**, `⟦IMPL⟧` — plus the arm, wrist and
neck actuators of 2.2, 9.2 kg at 80 Nm/kg, which do not scale with the body.

| Operating point | γ | Body mass |
|---|---|---|
| **2 h, durable pack — the reference design, with a dock (D-8)** | 2.6 | **76–123 kg** |
| 4 h, durable pack | 3.4 | **99–160 kg** |
| 8 h, ceiling pack | 3.4 | **99–160 kg** |
| 6 h, durable pack | 4.8 | 141–228 kg — *outside the sensible region* |

**Independent cross-check.** A real 1.2 m, 35 kg, 25-DOF humanoid scaled by mass
ratio `(1.65/1.2)³ = 2.60` gives **~91 kg** for a 1.65 m body of the same
architecture, before armour. That figure lands inside the 76–123 kg band at
the 2-hour mark, beside the reference design's 96 kg. Two independent derivations — one from the coupled
loop, one from geometric scaling of a machine that exists — agree to an order of
magnitude.

## 2.6 Actuation and manipulation

| Property | Envelope | Maturity |
|---|---|---|
| Specific power | **3–5 kW/kg** | **TM** |
| Specific torque | **80–90 Nm/kg peak** — see below | **TM**, at a 16:1 reduction; the same motor at 48:1 is sold at 159 Nm/kg — see below |
| Efficiency | 75–82% | **TM** |
| Response | milliseconds | **TM** |
| Joints | precision bearings with harmonic or cycloidal reducers | **TM** |
| Balance | IMU with ZMP control and reaction wheels | **TM** |
| Adhesion | gecko-type dry adhesive, moderate load | **LAB** |

### The basis matters as much as the number

Torque density is quoted on two incompatible bases, differing by a factor of
four. **Peak torque over actuator module mass** — motor, gearbox and housing —
is what module datasheets give, and what this specification declares. **Total
integrated actuator mass**, counting cooling and wiring, yields 18–22 Nm/kg for
the state of the art. A figure carried across from one basis to the other will
size a body that cannot be built.

**This specification declares peak-over-module, at the reduction ratio of the
modules it was derived from — about 16:1, ~100 rpm no-load.** Torque density
is not a ceiling of the motor: the same motor sold at 48:1 claims 159 Nm/kg at
about half the speed ([electrical §6b](https://github.com/PloneMraz/GEMs/blob/HEAD/hardware/electrical/README.md#6b-arm-payload-and-the-two-parts-of-f_act--2026-09-26)).
What the ratio trades is output speed, so a density figure without its ratio,
like one without its basis, is a number waiting to be misread. The cost of
standing at 80–90 is still real: part availability narrows to a handful of
modules, and the joints that need more torque than those modules give must
take a higher ratio and lose speed, which the sizing here does not yet check.

### Why 80 is the floor

The declared kinematics need **2475 Nm** summed across 31 joints at the 96 kg
reference point ([joint-by-joint sizing](https://github.com/PloneMraz/GEMs/tree/HEAD/hardware/electrical/)); 1737 Nm of it scales with body mass and 738 Nm does not.
The three trunk axes are sized from measured human trunk strength per kilogram
([electrical §6a](https://github.com/PloneMraz/GEMs/blob/HEAD/hardware/electrical/README.md#6a-trunk-lateral-bend-torque--research-2026-09-26)),
the arms from the declared payload below
([electrical §6b](https://github.com/PloneMraz/GEMs/blob/HEAD/hardware/electrical/README.md#6b-arm-payload-and-the-two-parts-of-f_act--2026-09-26)).
Divide:

| Density | Actuator mass | `f_act` |
|---|---|---|
| 80 Nm/kg | 30.9 kg | **0.32** |
| 85 Nm/kg | 29.1 kg | 0.30 |
| 90 Nm/kg | 27.5 kg | **0.29** |

**The declared band and the `f_act` band of 2.2 are the same constraint seen
twice.** 80–90 Nm/kg maps onto `f_act` 0.29–0.32. The arithmetic alone would
allow a floor near 74 Nm/kg, where `f_act` touches 0.35; the declared floor
was kept at 80 when the arm payload came down on 2026-09-26, as margin — for
decision D-1 on the knee, for a dynamic trunk figure above the isometric one,
and for the continuous-torque question electrical §6b leaves open. Below the
floor the actuators eat the mass budget and the loop stops converging. The two
figures cannot drift apart, because each is derivable from the other and
`scripts/gems_budget.py --check` holds them together.

### Arm torque

**Declared group 2 capability:** daily manipulation and moderate precision, with
**15 kg in one hand, arm straight and horizontal, load at the grip centre** —
the posture of maximum gravitational moment. Shoulder roll carries the same
posture abducted, at 11 kg. Decided 2026-09-26; the reasoning is at
[electrical §6b](https://github.com/PloneMraz/GEMs/blob/HEAD/hardware/electrical/README.md#6b-arm-payload-and-the-two-parts-of-f_act--2026-09-26).

The lever is to the grip centre, not the fingertip: 0.61 m from the shoulder and 0.31 m from the elbow
([`hardware/kinematics.md`](https://github.com/PloneMraz/GEMs/blob/HEAD/hardware/kinematics.md#2-reach-and-segment-lengths)).
The arm's own weight is added — its joint modules weighed at 80 Nm/kg from
their own torque, plus structure and hand allowances that are `⟦IMPL⟧` until
CAD exists:

| Joint | Payload | Self-weight | Peak |
|---|---|---|---|
| Shoulder pitch | 90 | 14 | **104 Nm** |
| Shoulder roll | 66 | 14 | **80 Nm** |
| Elbow | 46 | 4 | **50 Nm** |

For the lever alone, `τ = M·g·L`, with the corresponding actuator mass at
80 Nm/kg:

| Load | 0.40 m | 0.55 m | 0.61 m, grip at full reach |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 kg | 20 Nm (0.25 kg) | 27 Nm (0.34 kg) | 30 Nm (0.37 kg) |
| 15 kg | 59 Nm (0.74 kg) | 81 Nm (1.01 kg) | 90 Nm (1.12 kg) |
| 30 kg | 118 Nm (1.47 kg) | 162 Nm (2.02 kg) | 180 Nm (2.24 kg) |
| 50 kg | 196 Nm (2.45 kg) | 270 Nm (3.37 kg) | 299 Nm (3.74 kg) |

### Load cases

**Decided 2026-09-26: the declared loads are static objects.** Lifting,
carrying or dragging a person is outside group 2 — it needs dynamic factors no
source gives and a responsibility no paper design can carry. Safe contact with
people (group 4 of [01](/vault/gems/01-architecture/#application-frame)) is not a load
case and stays core: touching, steadying and walking beside are in; lifting is
out.

Each case is a mass, how many hands hold it, the horizontal lever from the
shoulder and elbow axes to its centre of mass, and a status. A load held close
to the body is carried by the legs and trunk, so its mass is added to every
per-kilogram row of theirs — the rule the sizing lacked until this date. Arm
self-weight is included. At the 96 kg reference point:

| Case | kg | Shoulder | Elbow | Hip | Trunk pitch | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| One hand, arm straight and horizontal | 15 | 104 | 50 | 196 | 193 | decided, D-10 |
| Bag hanging from one hand, arm down | 20 | 14 | 4 | 205 | 202 | proposed |
| Object hugged to the chest, two hands | 20 | 44 | 24 | 205 | 202 | proposed |
| Light object to a high shelf, one hand | 5 | 44 | 20 | 179 | 176 | proposed |
| Stairs with a load held close, two hands | 20 | 29 | 14 | 205 | 202 | proposed |

Two things the table says. The arm cases are cheap: the horizontal arm sets
the shoulder and nothing else comes near it. The leg cases are where the mass
goes: 20 kg held close costs the hip 35 Nm, whatever the hands do. The bag
hanging straight down costs the shoulder nothing and is a bearing case — the
AKH70-48 output bearing is rated 8680 N static, 18 times that bag.

**Carry capacity** follows: the leg joint with the largest per-kilogram demand
(hip pitch and knee, 1.77 Nm/kg) reaches a module's torque at
`(body + load) = torque / 1.77`. Against the AKH70-48's 222 Nm peak, the
2-hour body at 96 kg carries **29 kg** in one stand-up or step, while a
4-hour body at 125 kg carries **0 kg** — itself and nothing else. Every
kilogram off the body is a kilogram onto the hands, which is why D-8 and the
load cases are one decision, and why the reference design moved to 2 hours. At the module's 74 Nm rated torque no body in
2.5 climbs stairs with a load for long; how long its peak may be held is the
open question of [electrical §6b](https://github.com/PloneMraz/GEMs/blob/HEAD/hardware/electrical/README.md#6b-arm-payload-and-the-two-parts-of-f_act--2026-09-26).
`scripts/gems_budget.py` prints both figures for any point.

**A single joint is not the binding constraint, but the arms are the lever on
`f_act`.** The legs and trunk carry 1737 Nm of the 2475 and scale with the body,
so they set the absolute torque each module must deliver and the peak power of
2.7, not the fraction. The arms, wrists and neck are the fixed 738 Nm, and the
fixed part is what moves `f_act` when the body gets lighter — halving the
payload from the 30 kg this table once declared took `f_act` at 80 Nm/kg from
0.34 to 0.30 at the old 130 kg point, and the move to the 96 kg reference
point took it to 0.32: a lighter body, and a larger share of it in the arms.

## 2.7 Peak power is limited by the source, not the actuators

Actuators and pack both scale with the body, so both operating points of 2.5
have to be priced separately:

| Operating point | Body | Actuators accept | Pack | @3C | @5C | @10C |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **2 h, durable — reference** | ~96 kg | **93–155 kW** | 3.9 kWh | 12 kW | 19 kW | 38 kW |
| 4 h, durable | ~125 kg | **112–188 kW** | 10.0 kWh | 30 kW | 50 kW | 100 kW |

**The source falls short in every cell — by between 1.1× and 13×.** The
actuators' 3–5 kW/kg ceiling is not reachable from the battery at any point on
this table, and high-energy-density chemistries generally trade away C-rate, so
choosing the ceiling-grade pack widens the gap rather than closing it.

Only the most favourable corner — the larger pack at 10C against the low end of
the actuator band — comes close, at 1.1×. Everywhere else the margin is wide.

> Supercapacitors are listed as an option in [03](/vault/gems/03-energy/). These figures
> say it more precisely: **without them, the body's peak power is set by the
> battery, not by the actuators**, and every claim about fast reflex, catching
> and jumping falls in the source-limited region. A supercapacitor does not
> change total energy; it changes instantaneous power available. Fitting one
> remains `⟦CTRL⟧`, but the trade is now quantified.

## 2.8 Hard constraints

Three axes draw on one budget and **cannot all be maximised**:

| Axis | Increasing it |
|---|---|
| **Protection** (coverage × level) | raises `m_ext`, multiplied by `γ` |
| **Free-running endurance** | raises `f_bat` → `γ` inflates non-linearly → divergence at `t_max` |
| **Stature** (height) | mass by the cube, armour area by the square |

**Choose two; pay on the third.** A body is not free to weigh whatever it likes:
the coupled loop converges only in a narrow region, and the energy measures of
[03](/vault/gems/03-energy/) are what widen that region, by lowering effective `p`.

**Operating point: `⟦CTRL⟧`.**
